# Notification Listener for Android

This repository aims to capture all your phone notification and dynamically display them into a List.

This repository uses these plugins:
- Notifications from [CACHET Flutter plugins](https://github.com/cph-cachet/flutter-plugins).

## Getting Started

Just type on your terminal `flutter run` or press `ctrl + F5` in order to execute the app on your phone and watch any notification at the debug console plus the app list.

This is still a work in progress as I am newbie into Flutter.
